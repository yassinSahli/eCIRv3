### Vulnerability Finding: MAC Flooding / Probing Detection

**Endpoint:** `Lab Network Segment`  
**Date Identified:** 25/09/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description

During packet inspection on the monitored network segment, traffic originating from multiple sparse sources was detected that **did not belong to the sniffed network segment**. Trailer log messages indicated that these packets were **crafted by a malicious user**.  

Analysis using statistical features revealed that certain devices sent only **single packets before immediately disconnecting**, which is atypical for legitimate hosts. This behavior is indicative of **MAC flooding attempts or reconnaissance probes**, where an attacker tests connectivity or gathers network information without establishing normal communication flows.  

---

## Impact

- **Network Disruption:** Excessive MAC flooding may overwhelm the switch CAM table, leading to broadcast storms.  
- **Reconnaissance:** Attacker can map the network and identify active devices.  
- **Potential MITM Preparation:** Flooding or spoofed MAC addresses may enable Man-in-the-Middle attacks.  

This represents a **medium risk**, signaling early-stage malicious activity.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Reconnaissance**  
  - **T1595.001 – Active Scanning: Network Scanning**: Identifying live hosts and MAC addresses.  
- **Discovery**  
  - **T1046 – Network Service Scanning**: Detecting devices and network topology.

## Recommendation

**Immediate Response:**  
- Monitor and isolate suspicious MAC addresses generating abnormal traffic.  
- Capture additional network traffic for forensic analysis.  

**Remediation:**  
- Enable **port security** on switches to limit MAC addresses per port.  
- Implement **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** and MAC address monitoring.  
- Update network segmentation policies to limit broadcast domain exposure.  

**Preventive Measures:**  
- Continuously audit switch CAM tables for anomalies.  
- Regularly review network statistics to detect single-packet or sparse-origin probes.  

**Monitoring:**  
- Configure IDS/IPS rules to alert on MAC flooding or abnormal single-packet activity.  
- Integrate logs into SIEM for trend analysis and early warning.

**Severity:** Medium  
**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 6.5 – Potential disruption and reconnaissance activity without immediate exploitation.
