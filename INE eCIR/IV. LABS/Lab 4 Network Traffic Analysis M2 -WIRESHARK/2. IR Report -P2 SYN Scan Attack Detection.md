### Vulnerability Finding: SYN Scan / 3-Way Handshake Abuse

**Endpoint:** `192.168.1.2` (Lab Environment)  
**Date Identified:** 25/09/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description

Traffic inspection revealed a large number of **SYN packets** sent to host `192.168.1.2` without the corresponding **SYN/ACK** responses. This indicates that the scanning host was attempting to enumerate open ports using a **SYN scan** technique, which abuses the TCP 3-way handshake.  

Additionally, analysis of the **Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs)** showed that the scanning host reused the same ISN across multiple connection attempts. This behavior is abnormal and highly consistent with the **Nmap OS fingerprinting technique**, which relies on ISN analysis to guess the target operating system.  

---

## Impact

- **Reconnaissance:** Attacker maps live hosts and open ports without completing TCP connections.  
- **OS Fingerprinting:** Abnormal ISN reuse suggests the use of Nmap to profile the target system.  
- **Stealth Scanning:** SYN scans often bypass intrusion detection systems by leaving half-open connections.  

This constitutes a **medium-to-high risk** since it is a precursor to targeted attacks.

## Evidence

1. **Multiple SYN packets without corresponding SYN/ACK responses**

2. **Abnormal ISN reuse by the scanning host (`0` sequence value)**

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Reconnaissance**  
  - **T1595.001 – Active Scanning: SYN Scanning**  
- **Discovery**  
  - **T1046 – Network Service Scanning**  

---

## Recommendation

**Immediate Response:**  
- Identify and block the scanning source (`192.168.1.x`).  
- Log all repeated half-open TCP connections for correlation.  

**Remediation:**  
- Configure IDS/IPS rules to detect SYN flood/scans.  
- Enable SYN cookies to mitigate stealth scan enumeration.  

**Preventive Measures:**  
- Segment sensitive services away from untrusted networks.  
- Harden OS TCP/IP stack against abnormal ISN probing.  

**Monitoring:**  
- Continuously monitor for repeated SYN requests without ACK completion.

**Severity:** Medium-High  
**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 7.0 – Clear reconnaissance and fingerprinting attempt.
