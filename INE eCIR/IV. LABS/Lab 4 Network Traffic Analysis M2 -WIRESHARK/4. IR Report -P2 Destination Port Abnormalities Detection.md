### Vulnerability Finding: Destination Port Abnormalities

**Endpoint:** `192.168.1.6` (Lab Environment)  
**Date Identified:** 25/09/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description

Traffic analysis revealed that host `192.168.1.6` sent TCP packets to **destination port 0**, which is **not a valid listening port**.  

This is a clear indicator of a **scanning attempt**, as attackers sometimes target port 0 to check if the host is alive. A legitimate host should respond with an **RST** to indicate the port is unavailable.  

For a successful **TCP RST attack**, an attacker would need prior knowledge of the following:  

- Source Port  
- Destination Port  
- Source IP  
- Destination IP  
- Correct Sequence Number  

---

## Impact

- **Host Discovery:** Scanning port 0 helps attackers identify live hosts.  
- **Reconnaissance:** Confirms target availability without triggering standard connection alerts.  
- **Preparation for Exploitation:** May precede targeted TCP session attacks or hijacking.  

This constitutes a **medium risk**, as it represents initial reconnaissance activity.

## Evidence

1. **Packets sent to TCP port 0**

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Reconnaissance**  
  - **T1595.001 – Active Scanning: Port Scanning**  
- **Discovery**  
  - **T1046 – Network Service Scanning**

## Recommendation

**Immediate Response:**  
- Monitor and log traffic targeting invalid destination ports.  
- Alert on repeated attempts to port 0 from a single source.  

**Remediation:**  
- Block scanning hosts at the firewall.  
- Configure IDS/IPS to detect packets targeting reserved or invalid ports.  

**Preventive Measures:**  
- Segment critical systems away from untrusted networks.  
- Maintain robust logging and monitoring for unusual port activity.  

**Monitoring:**  
- Analyze unusual destination ports and integrate alerts into SIEM dashboards.

**Severity:** Medium  
**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 6.0 – Reconnaissance activity, no direct exploitation observed.
