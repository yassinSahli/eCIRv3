### Vulnerability Finding: Source Port Abnormalities

**Endpoint:** `192.168.1.6` (Lab Environment)  
**Date Identified:** 25/09/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description

Analysis of the TCP streams for host `192.168.1.6` revealed that it repeatedly used the **same source port (`36901`)** for multiple connection attempts to different destination ports on the target host.  

This behavior is **abnormal** because under normal TCP/IP stack behavior, the **ephemeral source port should increment** with each new connection attempt. Reuse of a fixed source port is often associated with **scanning tools** that prioritize efficiency over protocol compliance.  

---

## Impact

- **Evasion:** Abnormal source port usage can bypass naive firewall or IDS rules.  
- **Fingerprinting:** Consistent port reuse is a strong indicator of automated scanning.  
- **Preparation for Exploitation:** The attacker may be mapping services systematically using crafted source ports.  

This constitutes a **medium risk**, consistent with reconnaissance activity.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Reconnaissance**  
  - **T1595.001 – Active Scanning: Port Scanning**  
- **Discovery**  
  - **T1046 – Network Service Scanning**

## Recommendation

**Immediate Response:**  
- Flag and alert on traffic with fixed/reused source ports.  
- Correlate with other reconnaissance indicators from host `192.168.1.6`.  

**Remediation:**  
- Enforce firewall rules to detect and block abnormal source port behavior.  
- Enhance IDS/IPS signatures for port scanning activity.  

**Preventive Measures:**  
- Monitor for repetitive source ports across multiple destination ports.  
- Segment vulnerable systems away from networks exposed to scanning.  

**Monitoring:**  
- Continuously log all source port behaviors and alert on anomalies.

**Severity:** Medium  
**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 6.0 – Suspicious reconnaissance activity with abnormal port behavior.
