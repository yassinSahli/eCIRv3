## **Objective**

Analyze the `incident_3.pcap` file using Bro logs and identify abnormal SSL behavior suggesting **malware beaconing activity**.

---

## **Step 1 – Clean Previous Logs**(optional)

Before analysis, delete any previously generated logs:

`rm -f *.log`

---

## **Step 2 – Run Bro on the PCAP**

Execute Bro while ignoring TCP checksum errors:

`bro -C -r PCAPs/incident_3.pcap local`

👉 This generates fresh Bro logs such as `conn.log`, `ssl.log`, and others.

---

## **Step 3 – Inspect Connections**

Check the connections:

`cat conn.log`

Observation:

- Bro identifies **SSL traffic on port 80**.
    
- Normally, SSL/TLS runs on port 443 → SSL on port 80 is **suspicious**.
    

---

## **Step 4 – Inspect SSL Traffic**

Examine SSL logs:

`cat ssl.log`
![[Pasted image 20250927235626.png]]
Observations:

- Presence of **self-signed certificates**.
    
- Certificates themselves may not be malicious, but when paired with unusual behavior, they become suspicious.
    

---

## **Step 5 – Correlate with Timestamps**

Compare timestamps between `conn.log` and `ssl.log`:

- The client communicates with the remote server **every 5 seconds**.
    
- Such **regular, periodic connections** are not typical for normal SSL traffic.
    
- This strongly indicates **beaconing behavior**.
    

---

## **Step 6 – Conclusion**

The evidence suggests the following:

1. SSL traffic was detected on a **non-standard port (80)**.
    
2. Communication used **self-signed certificates**.
    
3. Connections occurred **at fixed intervals (every 5 seconds)**.
    

👉 These are strong indicators of **malware beaconing** — where an infected host regularly “calls home” to a Command & Control (C2) server for instructions.

---

## **Outcome**

- Bro successfully detected abnormal SSL communication patterns.
    
- Analysis confirms **malware beaconing over SSL on port 80**.
    
- This case highlights the importance of analyzing both **protocol mismatches** (SSL on port 80) and **timing patterns** (periodic connections).
