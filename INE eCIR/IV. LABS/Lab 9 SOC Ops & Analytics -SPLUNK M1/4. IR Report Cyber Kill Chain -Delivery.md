# Delivery Activities by APT Group Targeting Wayne Enterprises

**Endpoint:** `Open Source Investigation / botsv1`  
**Date Identified:** 03/10/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description
Following the weaponization phase, the investigation focused on the **delivery phase** of the APT group targeting Wayne Enterprises. OSINT sources including ThreatMiner and VirusTotal were leveraged to identify malware, delivery methods, and related infrastructure.  

The suspicious IP **23.22.63.114** was the pivot point for discovering malware samples and delivery artifacts. Analysis of these samples provided insight into the tools and TTPs used by the adversary to deliver malicious payloads, confirming a progression from reconnaissance and weaponization to active delivery attempts.

## Impact
Delivery activities indicate that the adversary has operationalized their attack and is attempting to place malicious payloads within the target environment. Risks include:  

- **Malware introduction:** Executable files such as `MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe` could compromise endpoints.  
- **Credential theft or lateral movement:** Delivered malware may enable persistence, reconnaissance, or exfiltration.  
- **Operational disruption:** Execution of unknown binaries can lead to service outages or further compromise.

## Evidence

### Step 1: ThreatMiner IP Lookup
Suspicious IP **23.22.63.114** was submitted to ThreatMiner to identify malware samples associated with the adversary:

- Results displayed malware hashes and related indicators linked to the IP, revealing delivery tools used by the APT group.

---

### Step 2: VirusTotal Malware Analysis
Collected MD5 hashes from ThreatMiner were submitted to VirusTotal for enrichment:  

**Hash analyzed:** `c99131e0169171935c5ac32615ed6261`

- VirusTotal reports provided AV detections, malware families, behavior analysis, and associated samples.  

---

### Step 3: Persistence Through Filenames
- Malware filenames can persist across campaigns even if hashes change.  
- Filename discovered: `MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe`  

*Note:* Filename should be treated as an IoC for monitoring and detection purposes.

---

### Step 4: Updated Cyber Kill Chain
- The delivery stage was added to the cyber kill chain, documenting the transition from **weaponization** to **delivery**.

- Delivery method: Suspicious executable (`.scr.exe`) delivered via phishing infrastructure associated with pre-staged domains and IPs.

### Step 5: Splunk Queries for Detection
Correlate OSINT findings with internal logs:

```spl
# Search for malware filename in endpoint logs
index=botsv1 sourcetype=endpoint_logs "MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe"

# Search for IP/domain communication attempts
index=botsv1 (src=23.22.63.114 OR dest=23.22.63.114) sourcetype=stream:http

# Search DNS logs for phishing domains tied to 23.22.63.114
index=botsv1 sourcetype=dns (query="*wayncorpinc.com" OR query="_relatedphishingdomain_")
