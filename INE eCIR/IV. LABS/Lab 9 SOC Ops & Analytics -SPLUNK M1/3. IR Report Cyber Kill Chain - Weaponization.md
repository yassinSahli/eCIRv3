# Weaponization Activities Targeting Wayne Enterprises

**Endpoint:** `Open Source Investigation / botsv1`  
**Date Identified:** 03/10/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description
Following the reconnaissance phase, the investigation shifted to **weaponization activities** to identify domains and infrastructure being pre-staged for attacks against Wayne Enterprises. The focus was on the suspicious IP **23.22.63.114**, which lacked sufficient visibility in Splunk logs.  

OSINT analysis using Robtex, ThreatCrowd, VirusTotal, and WHOIS revealed multiple domains likely prepared for phishing or other malicious activity. Reverse email searches further enriched the dataset, confirming additional infrastructure used by the adversary. These findings highlight that the APT group has progressed from reconnaissance toward **preparing attack capabilities**.

## Impact
Weaponization activities indicate that the adversary is readying infrastructure to facilitate attacks. Risks include:
- **Phishing campaigns:** Pre-registered domains mimic the organization’s branding and may target employees.  
- **Malware delivery / exploitation readiness:** Prepared domains can host malicious payloads or direct users to exploit kits.  
- **Operational exposure:** These activities increase the probability of successful social engineering or technical exploitation.

The adversary demonstrates **moderate sophistication**, relying on pre-staged domains and email infrastructure to streamline attack deployment.

## Evidence

### Step 1: Robtex IP Lookup
Suspicious IP **23.22.63.114** was submitted to Robtex to identify associated domains:

### Step 2: Additional OSINT Enrichment
ThreatCrowd and VirusTotal were queried for the same IP to identify further domains and threat associations:

### Step 3: WHOIS Information of Suspicious Domains
WHOIS records for **wayncorpinc.com** revealed registration details indicative of targeted planning:

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **T1588 – Obtain Capabilities**
  - Pre-staging domains and email infrastructure for attacks.  
- **T1583 – Acquire Infrastructure**
  - Registration of phishing or malicious domains targeting Wayne Enterprises.  
- **T1598 – Phishing**
  - Preparing domains and email addresses for social engineering campaigns.

## Recommendation

1. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - Block network and email traffic associated with identified domains linked to **23.22.63.114**.  
   - Monitor for suspicious connections to newly registered domains resembling corporate branding.

2. **Infrastructure Hardening**
   - Enforce DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to prevent phishing abuse.  
   - Educate staff to recognize potential phishing domains and emails.

3. **Detection & Monitoring**
   - Configure Splunk alerts to detect connections or communications with pre-staged domains.  
   - Integrate OSINT feeds to track additional domains associated with the adversary.

4. **Threat Hunting**
   - Search across all external-facing systems for active exploitation attempts from weaponized domains.  
   - Correlate OSINT findings with internal SIEM logs to detect early indicators of compromise.

## Severity and CVSS

- **Severity:** Medium–High  
- **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  
- **CVSS Base Score:** 6.3 (Medium)
