# Reconnaissance Activities Against imreallynotbatman.com

**Endpoint:** `Open Source Investigation / botsv1`  
**Date Identified:** 03/10/2025  
**Tester:** Mr. Yassine SAHLI

## Description
During the investigation, Splunk logs revealed evidence of reconnaissance activities targeting Wayne Enterprises’ public website: **imreallynotbatman.com**. The analysis focused on the `stream:http` and `suricata` sourcetypes to identify suspicious traffic patterns and potential adversary activities.  

The primary source of reconnaissance was identified as IP address **40.80.148.42**, responsible for approximately **95% of the HTTP traffic** directed at the target site. A secondary IP (**23.22.63.114**) also generated reconnaissance-related traffic, but to a lesser extent. Further correlation with Suricata alerts confirmed that these connections were not benign but aligned with scanning activity.  

## Impact
This reconnaissance activity demonstrates an adversary’s attempt to enumerate and probe the target web infrastructure before executing further stages of an attack. The risks include:
- **Exposure of vulnerabilities:** Automated scanning tools like Acunetix WVS may identify web application flaws (SQLi, XSS, misconfigurations).
- **Targeted exploitation:** The discovered vulnerabilities could later be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
- **Operational disruption:** Enumeration of system components increases the attack surface for the adversary.

The use of automated scanning highlights the adversary’s intent to perform large-scale reconnaissance, potentially preparing for exploitation or lateral movement.

## Evidence

### Step 1: Initial Traffic Search

Search across Splunk for traffic to the target domain:
```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com
```

### Step 2: Source Identification

Focused search on `stream:http` sourcetype revealed suspicious hosts:
```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype=stream:http
```

- **40.80.148.42 (~95% of HTTP traffic)**
- **23.22.63.114**
### Step 3: Suricata Validation

Cross-checked with Suricata logs:
```
`index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com src=40.80.148.42 sourcetype=suricata`
```

Suricata signatures confirmed active scanning activity from **40.80.148.42**.

### Step 4: Sophistication Assessment

Analysis of HTTP headers and user-agent strings revealed the tool **Acunetix WVS** was used:
```
`index=botsv1 src=40.80.148.42 sourcetype=stream:http`
```

- User-Agent: **acunetix_wvs_security_test**
- Destination server: **192.168.250.70**

This indicates reliance on a well-known vulnerability scanner rather than custom, stealthy tools.

### Step 5: Requested Resources

Further analysis of URIs and HTTP status codes:
```
index=botsv1 dest=192.168.250.70 sourcetype=stream:http status=200 stats count by uri | sort - count
```

Complementary analysis via IIS logs confirmed the same targeted host:
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=iis sc_status=200 | stats values(cs_uri_stem)
```

### Step 6: Cyber Kill Chain

The reconnaissance phase was mapped to the cyber kill chain:  

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **T1595 – Active Scanning**
    
    - Use of Acunetix for automated vulnerability detection.
        
- **T1592 – Gather Victim Host Information**
    
    - Discovery of active web services and endpoints.
        
- **T1046 – Network Service Scanning**
    
    - Enumeration of web application endpoints to identify attack surfaces.
        

## Recommendation

1. **Immediate Mitigation**
    
    - Block or monitor traffic from identified malicious IPs (`40.80.148.42`, `23.22.63.114`).
        
    - Apply WAF rules to detect and block automated vulnerability scanners.
        
2. **Web Application Hardening**
    
    - Patch all exposed services (IIS, web applications).
        
    - Disable unused or legacy endpoints on `192.168.250.70`.
        
3. **Detection & Monitoring**
    
    - Create Splunk alerts for uncommon User-Agent strings (e.g., _acunetix_wvs_security_test_).
        
    - Implement Suricata signatures to detect automated scanners in real-time.
        
4. **Threat Hunting**
    
    - Search for additional reconnaissance attempts across all external-facing systems.
        
    - Monitor for exploitation attempts following reconnaissance activity.
