### Malicious Privilege Escalation Binary `bleidi`

**Endpoint:** `XUBUNTU` 
Hex inspection of the binary confirms that it contains code attempting **local privilege escalation**, likely intended to provide an attacker with a **root shell** on the system. This indicates the endpoint has been compromised with a **local privilege escalation malware**.

---
## Impact

- **Privilege Escalation:** The binary allows a standard user to gain root privileges.  
- **Complete System Compromise:** Root access enables full control of the machine, including modification of system files, installation of additional malware, and persistence mechanisms.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Compromised root credentials may be used to access other systems in the network.  
- **Stealthy Persistence:** Malicious binaries running as root can evade detection and maintain persistent access.  

This represents a **critical security risk**, as it allows attackers to gain unrestricted access to the system.

## Evidence

1. **Suspicious process execution:** `bleidi` running under `elsuser` and then elevated to root privileges.

2. **Binary location and analysis:** Re-collected binary stored in Downloads folder. HexView inspection shows code indicative of privilege escalation.  
/home/elsuser/Downloads/bleidi

3. **Execution flow:** Process executed by a standard user but elevated to root without authorization.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Privilege Escalation**
- **T1068 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** The `bleidi` binary attempts to escalate privileges from a standard user to root.  
- **Persistence**
- **T1547 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** Binary may install or configure itself to maintain root-level persistence.  
- **Execution**
- **T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter:** Binary execution provides attacker a root shell for executing arbitrary commands.

## Recommendation

**Immediate Response:**
- Terminate the `bleidi` process immediately.  
- Quarantine the binary for further forensic analysis.  
- Isolate the endpoint to prevent lateral movement.

**Remediation:**
- Remove the malicious `bleidi` binary from the system.  
- Audit all user and root sessions to check for unauthorized access.  
- Check system logs for any abnormal activities correlated with the binary execution.

**Preventive Measures:**
- Enforce least privilege principles to restrict unnecessary root access.  
- Implement endpoint monitoring to detect execution of unknown binaries with escalated privileges.  
- Regularly educate users on safe handling of downloaded files and executables.

**Monitoring:**
- Enable real-time alerts for processes that gain root privileges unexpectedly.  
- Periodically review user Downloads directories for suspicious binaries.  
- Continuously audit local privilege escalation attempts on Linux endpoints.

**Severity:** Critical  
**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 9.8 (Critical – Local privilege escalation leading to full system compromise)
